<h2> Case Study: Driving Digital Transformation and Enhancing Customer Experience at Bredband2</h2>

<h3>Introduction: </h3>

<p>During my tenure as a full-stack developer at Bredband2, a leading telecommunications company, I had the opportunity to contribute to various critical projects that significantly impacted the organization's digital presence, security measures, and overall customer experience. In this case study, I will highlight three key initiatives that exemplify my skills, dedication, and problem-solving abilities. </p>

<br />
<h3>Project 1: Redesigning the Digital Identity </h3>

<p>One of the standout projects during my tenure at Bredband2 was the complete redesign of their website, incorporating a fresh visual identity. This venture presented unique challenges, as the external designer lacked prior experience in web design and adherence to WCAG standards. To overcome this obstacle, we hired Rebecca, a seasoned senior designer and UX expert, whose valuable insights and guidance empowered me to effectuate meaningful changes.</p>

<p>Taking on the role of a full-stack developer, I collaborated closely with Rebecca, leveraging her expertise to bridge the gap between design and implementation. By effectively communicating and incorporating her recommendations, we successfully delivered a visually captivating and user-centric website that adhered to industry best practices, enhancing Bredband2's brand perception and elevating the overall user experience.</p>

<br />
<h3> Project 2: Development of "Mitt Bredband2" Customer Portal </h3>

<p>During my time at Bredband2, I played a crucial role in the development of "Mitt Bredband2," a customer portal that provided users with secure access to personalized account information and services. This customer portal allowed users to log in using bankID or their username and password. By providing a comprehensive self-service platform, users could view account details, manage services, and engage in real-time chats as logged-in customers.</p>

<p>The implementation of the customer portal had a significant impact on Bredband2's operations. By empowering users to handle account-related tasks independently, we observed a decrease in calls to the service center, leading to cost savings for the organization. Additionally, I spearheaded the implementation of a feature that enabled users to easily upgrade or downgrade their services directly from the customer portal, reducing the reliance on customer service interventions.</p>

<br />
<h3>Professional Growth and Accomplishments:</h3>

<p> Throughout my journey at Bredband2, I continually pursued personal and professional development, acquiring new skills and certifications to enhance my capabilities as a versatile developer. Some noteworthy achievements during my time include:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Proficiency in Ruby on Rails: I gained expertise in developing web applications using Ruby on Rails, enabling efficient and scalable solutions for Bredband2's platform.</li>

    <li>Cloudflare Pages: I expanded my knowledge and hands-on experience with Cloudflare Pages, harnessing its capabilities to optimize website performance and security. </li>

    <li>Certifications: I pursued Google Analytics and UX certifications, validating my expertise in data-driven decision-making and user-centric design principles.</li>

    <li>Self-Leadership Course: I successfully completed a self-leadership course, enhancing my ability to manage projects, collaborate effectively, and drive results in a dynamic environment.</li>

    <li>TypeScript Familiarity: I delved into TypeScript, augmenting my understanding of this statically typed superset of JavaScript, which facilitated the development of more robust and scalable code.</li>

    <li>Docker Troubleshooting: Overcoming various challenges with Docker, I honed my troubleshooting skills and adopted Orbstack for streamlined management of machines and containers.</li>

    <li>GitHub Action Development: I created a custom GitHub Action that automates checks on pull requests, providing an overview of repository size, linking to relevant issues, and displaying various checks' status.</li>

    <li>Introduction to Cybersecurity: I earned my first Cisco certificate, specifically Introduction to Cybersecurity, broadening my knowledge of information security principles and practices.</li>

</ul>
<br />

My time at Bredband2 was characterized by my dedication to driving digital transformation, enhancing security measures, and improving the overall customer experience.
