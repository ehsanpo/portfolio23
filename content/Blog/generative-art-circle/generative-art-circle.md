Recently, I've been playing around with some generative music using Propellerhead Reason, mostly for fun, you can find some of it on my Soundcloud:

This got me to start thinking about some generative art; after some Googling I got to check out some R programming for drawing things, and after some lurking around Github I found some good examples written in go and python too. Got to install R and Processing 3 on my Mac. After trying to get the process working for a few hours, I was not lucky, and after some digging up I saw a lot of problems with the processor 3 and java versions. But v2 worked and i got my first images.
At this point I just want to make some pretty art and not do too much into learning the generative algorithms that are already in place.
