            I write this blog personally focused mostly on tech-related
            articles, but I sometimes write about my day to day experience as a
            web developer. I feel that this is an excellent way to channel my
            ideas and thoughts through this blog.
          </p>
          <p>
            I write what I feel is essential on current modern technology, or
            what the future technology beholds. And maybe some special
            tools/things that can be used to create a better internet experience
          </p>
          <p>
            It is incredible to know what we donâ€™t know. I think that those with
            the thirst for knowledge can change this world. I have that thirst,
            and I quench it by not only learning about new technology and other
            things, I also share it with you, through this blog.
